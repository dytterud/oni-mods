## What shipped

<!-- What does this PR do, and why? If it fixes a bug, describe how the bug
is reached — reproduction beats speculation. -->

## Design decisions

<!-- Anything you decided that a reviewer might question: alternatives
rejected, deviations from existing patterns, scope deliberately left out.
Delete the section if there were none. -->

## Verification

<!--
What was actually run and what happened. Be explicit about what was NOT
verified — an honest gap is easy to check at review time; a hidden one isn't.
-->

- [ ] `dotnet build OniMods.slnx -c Release -p:OfflineBuild=true` succeeds
- [ ] `dotnet test` passes (if `src/` or `test/` changed)
- [ ] New/changed behaviour covered by a test that fails without the change
      (game-touching logic often has no seam — say so if it couldn't be tested)
- [ ] Manually exercised in-game with a real ONI install (say so, or note it wasn't)
